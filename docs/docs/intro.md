## Overview

<p>
<b>anansi</b> is a collection of open source tools aimed at easing the adoption of machine learning within your applications. Currently
the project is focused on two primary workstreams:
<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating and evaluating embeddings using the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard" target="_blank">Massive Text Embedding</a> leaderboard, on both CPUs and GPUs.</li>
<li>Providing a correct and highly-performant embedding storage that runs within WASM.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
With one or both of the aforementioned pieces, developers can quickly augment their applications with machine learning <b>without relying on Python</b>. anansi allows one to:

<ul>
<li>Generate embeddings for text or images and semantically search through them.</li>
<li>Create recommendations by storing multi-dimensional features + searching using Hamming distance.</li>
<li>Fine tune their embeddings via a live continuous process.</li>
</ul>

<i>In the coming weeks (Q3 2023) anansi will be providing a managed service to further reduce adoption and setup costs.</i>
