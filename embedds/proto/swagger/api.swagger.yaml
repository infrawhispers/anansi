      summary: initialize_models
      description: Intializes an onnx model, adding it to the pool of models available
        for embedding generation. ONNX models are loaded from the folder
        designated by ```EMBBEDDS_CACHE_FOLDER``` and it is recommended that
        this folder be volume mounted if running within a container.<br/><br/>If
        the model is missing, the server will attempt to download the
        corresponding file from a remote source.<br/><br/>embedds must be
        created with ```EMBEDDS_ALLOW_ADMIN=true``` as the unrestricted creation
        of models can lead to resource starvation. If you are exposing the
        process to non-trusted clients, we recommended that
        ```EMBEDDS_ALLOW_ADMIN``` be set to false.
